Meeting Transcript - RecapFlow Development Session
Date: August 16, 2025
Participants: Development Team

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's review our progress on RecapFlow.

Mike: The backend FastAPI server is now running smoothly. We've successfully integrated Google Gemini AI for summarization.

Alex: Great! I've finished the frontend React interface with Tailwind CSS. The user can now test all API endpoints directly from the browser.

Sarah: What about the email functionality?

Mike: The SMTP integration is working. We're using proper HTML formatting for the emails with the RecapFlow branding.

Alex: The file upload feature is also ready. Users can upload .txt or .md files and the content automatically populates the summarization form.

Sarah: Excellent progress! What are our next steps?

Mike: We should focus on error handling and user experience improvements.

Alex: I agree. We also need to add loading states and better validation.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's plan for deployment testing next week.

Action Items:
- Mike: Enhance error handling in API endpoints
- Alex: Improve UI/UX with better loading states
- Sarah: Prepare deployment documentation
- Team: Conduct full integration testing
